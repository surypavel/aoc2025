# Advent of code 2025

Trying out Rust. Code can be run with

`cargo run --bin 01a`

## Notes to myself

- Day 1: Will need to learn how to parse strings properly, getting of direction/number should be easier.
- Day 2: Iterating over `start..=end` seems inefficient but it is what it is. 
- Day 3: Fun, a lot of off-by-one errors but my solution seems efficient. 
- Day 4: Very inefficient solution to recompute the whole map on every iteration, could have somehow updated the neighbours?
- Day 5: Super simple part 1, in part 2 just need to sort and reduce the intervals.
- Day 6: Had to do a complete rewrite for part 2. Wasn't hard but it took me quite a long time.
- Day 7: Not really hard but nice to have made it with a single top-to-bottom iteration.
