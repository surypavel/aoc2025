# Advent of code 2025

Trying out Rust. Code can be run with

`cargo run --bin 01a`

## Notes to myself

- Day 1: Will need to learn how to parse strings properly, getting of direction/number should be easier.
- Day 2: Iterating over `start..=end` seems inefficient but it is what it is. 
- Day 3: Fun, a lot of off-by-one errors but my solution seems efficient.
